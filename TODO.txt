  - add 3. in param.f90 - have the same parameters in input.nml as in CaNS (excl flow forcing?)
  - add 3. things would work similarly for initscal
  - add 3. namelists I/O and add an external bubble position radius and 2D parameters 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.25 T T T for a 3D bubble at [0.5,0.5,0.5] w/ radius 0.25
  - add 3. basic example files
  - add 3. momentum test - lid-driven cavity (done)
  - add 3. multiphase tests (2D rising bubble and capillary wave)
  - add 3. heat transfer tests (differentially heated cavity)
